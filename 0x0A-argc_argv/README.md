# C -argc, argv

This repo contains code written to understand `argc` and `argv`.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

## Code :page_with_curl:

* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  * Program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
    * If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
    * You should not remove the path before the name of the program

* **1. Silence is argument carried out by other means**
  * Program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

* **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
  * Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.
    * All arguments should be printed, including the first one
    * Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
 
* **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
  * Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
    * Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
    * You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
    * If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`

* **4. To infinity and beyond**
  * Write a program that adds positive numbers.
    * Print the result, followed by a new line
    * If no number is passed to the program, print `0`, followed by a new line
    * If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`
    * You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an `int`

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c): C function that returns the natural square root of a number.
