# C - Pointers, arrays, strings

This repo contains C software written to implement different functions. There is no use of a standard library.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. 98 Battery St**
  * [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): C program that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`

* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
  * [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): C function that swaps the values of 2 integers. 

* **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
  * [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): C function that returns the length of a string.

* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
  * [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. 

* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
  * [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): C function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line..

* **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**
  * [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): C function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.

* **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
  * [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): C function that prints a straight line.

* **7.  I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
  * [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c): C function that prints a diagonal line on the terminal.

* **8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
  * [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c): C function that prints a square of hashes on the terminal.

* **9. Fizz-Buzz**
  * [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): C function that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. Each number or word should be separated by a space

* **10. Triangles**
  * [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c): C function that pri.

* **11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**
  * [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c): The prime factors of `1231952` are `2`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `37` and `2081`. Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* **12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**
  * [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c): C function that prints an integer.
