# 0x03. C - Debugging

This repo contains tasks undertaken to debug and learn how to debug code written in C

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * [0-main.c](./0-main.c): Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`. The function `positive_or_negative` is defined [here](https://github.com/richie-omondi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  * [1-main.c](./1-main.c): Comment out (donâ€™t delete) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* **2. 0 > 972?**
  * [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): This program prints the largest of three numbers

* **3. Leap year**
  * [3-main_a.c](./3-main_a.c): This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
