# 0x03. C - Debugging

This repo contains tasks undertaken to debug and learn how to debug code written in C

## Taska :page_with_curl:

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * [0-main.c](./0-main.c): Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`. The function `positive_or_negative` iss defined [here](0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  * [1-main.c](./1-main.c): Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* **2. Assembler**
  * [2-assembler](./2-assembler): Bash script that generates the assembly code of a
  C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`; saves the result in an output file of the
  same name but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the result is `main.s`.

* **3. Name**
  * [3-name](./3-name): Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable
  `$CFILE` and creates an executable `cisfun`.

* **4. Hello, puts**
  * [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building
  a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.

* **5. Hello, printf**
  * [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c): C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but
  the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the function `printf`.

* **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * [6-size.c](./6-size.c): C program that prints the size of various types on the computer
  it is compiled and run on.

* **7. Intel**
  * [100-intel](./100-intel): Bash script that generates assembly code in Intel syntax of a
  C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name
  but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.s`.

* **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
  * [101-quote.c](./101-quote.c): C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is
  useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error,
  without using any functions listed in the NAME sesction of the man(3) `printf` or man(3)
  `puts`.
